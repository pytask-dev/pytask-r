Run R scripts with pytask.

## Installation

pytask-r is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytask-r) and
[Anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytask-r). Install it with

```console
$ pip install pytask-r

# or

$ conda install -c conda-forge pytask-r
```

You also need to have R installed and `Rscript` on your command line. Test it by typing
the following on the command line

```console
$ Rscript --help
```

If an error is shown instead of a help page, you can install R with `conda` by choosing
either R or Microsoft R Open (MRO). Choose one of the two following commands. (See
[here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/%20using-r-language) for
further explanation on Anaconda, R, and MRO.)

```console
$ conda install -c r r-base     # For normal R.
$ conda install -c r mro-base   # For MRO.
```

Or install install R from the official [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/).

## Usage

To create a task which runs a R script, define a task function with the `@pytask.mark.r`
decorator. The `script` keyword provides an absolute path or path relative to the task
module to the R script.

```python
import pytask


@pytask.mark.r(script="script.r")
@pytask.mark.produces("out.rds")
def task_run_r_script():
    pass
```

If you are wondering why the function body is empty, know that pytask-r replaces the
body with a predefined internal function. See the section on implementation details for
more information.

### Dependencies and Products

Dependencies and products can be added as with a normal pytask task using the
`@pytask.mark.depends_on` and `@pytask.mark.produces` decorators. which is explained in
this
[tutorial](https://pytask-dev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/defining_dependencies_products.html).

### Accessing dependencies and products in the script

To access the paths of dependencies and products in the script, pytask-r stores the
information by default in a `.json` file. The path to this file is passed as a
positional argument to the script. Inside the script, you can read the information.

```r
library(jsonlite)

args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)

path_to_json <- args[length(args)]

config <- read_json(path_to_json)

config$produces  # Is the path to the output file "../out.csv".
```

The `.json` file is stored in the same folder as the task in a `.pytask` directory.

To parse the JSON file, you need to install
[jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite).

You can also pass any other information to your script by using the `@pytask.mark.task`
decorator.

```python
@pytask.mark.task(kwargs={"number": 1})
@pytask.mark.r(script="script.r")
@pytask.mark.produces("out.rds")
def task_run_r_script():
    pass
```

and inside the script use

```r
config$number  # Is 1.
```

### Debugging

In case a task throws an error, you might want to execute the script independently from
pytask. After a failed execution, you see the command which executed the R script in the
report of the task. It looks roughly like this

```console
$ Rscript <options> script.r <path-to>/.pytask/task_py_task_example.json
```

### Command Line Arguments

The decorator can be used to pass command line arguments to `Rscript`. See the following
example.

```python
@pytask.mark.r(script="script.r", options="--vanilla")
@pytask.mark.produces("out.rds")
def task_run_r_script():
    pass
```

### Repeating tasks with different scripts or inputs

You can also repeat the execution of tasks, meaning executing multiple R scripts or
passing different command line arguments to the same R script.

The following task executes two R scripts, `script_1.r` and `script_2.r`, which produce
different outputs.

```python
for i in range(2):

    @pytask.mark.task
    @pytask.mark.r(script=f"script_{i}.r")
    @pytask.mark.produces(f"out_{i}.csv")
    def task_execute_r_script():
        pass
```

If you want to pass different inputs to the same R script, pass these arguments with the
`kwargs` keyword of the `@pytask.mark.task` decorator.

```python
for i in range(2):

    @pytask.mark.task(kwargs={"i": i})
    @pytask.mark.r(script="script.r")
    @pytask.mark.produces(f"output_{i}.csv")
    def task_execute_r_script():
        pass
```

and inside the task access the argument `i` with

```r
library(jsonlite)

args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)

path_to_json <- args[length(args)]

config <- read_json(path_to_json)

config$produces  # Is the path to the output file "../output_{i}.csv".

config$i  # Is the number.
```

### Serializers

You can also serialize your data with any other tool you like. By default, pytask-r also
supports YAML (if PyYaml is installed).

Use the `serializer` keyword arguments of the `@pytask.mark.r` decorator with

```python
@pytask.mark.r(script="script.r", serializer="yaml")
def task_example():
    ...
```

And in your R script use

```r
library(yaml)
args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE)
config <- read_yaml(args[length(args)])
```

Note that the `YAML` package needs to be installed.

If you need a custom serializer, you can also provide any callable to `serializer` which
transforms data to a string. Use `suffix` to set the correct file ending.

Here is a replication of the JSON example.

```python
import json


@pytask.mark.r(script="script.r", serializer=json.dumps, suffix=".json")
def task_example():
    ...
```

### Configuration

You can influence the default behavior of pytask-r with some configuration values.

**`r_serializer`**

Use this option to change the default serializer.

```toml
[tool.pytask.ini_options]
r_serializer = "json"
```

**`r_suffix`**

Use this option to set the default suffix of the file which contains serialized paths to
dependencies and products and more.

```toml
[tool.pytask.ini_options]
r_suffix = ".json"
```

**`r_options`**

Use this option to set default options for each task which are separated by whitespace.

```toml
[tool.pytask.ini_options]
r_options = ["--vanilla"]
```
